# SkillSwap – Hyperlocal Talent Exchange

SkillSwap is a community-driven web platform designed to connect individuals within the same neighborhood through skill bartering. Instead of relying on money, users can offer a skill they possess — such as coding, cooking, graphic design, or music — in exchange for learning a skill they’re interested in. Think of it as a local marketplace for talent, where value is exchanged through knowledge, not currency.

The platform aims to empower people to grow together, foster stronger offline community bonds, and unlock opportunities for peer-to-peer learning. Whether it’s a student teaching Python in return for guitar lessons, or a designer learning photography from a neighbor, SkillSwap believes everyone has something to offer and something to learn.
